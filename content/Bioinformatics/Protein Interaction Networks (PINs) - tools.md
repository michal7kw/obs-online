Protein Interaction Networks (PINs) are essential tools in bioinformatics and systems biology, providing insights into the complex web of protein interactions within a cell.

Examples:

1. **Biogrid (Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets)**: A curated database that collects and distributes genetic and protein interaction data from various organisms. It focuses on providing high-quality data on protein interactions, genetic interactions, chemical associations, and post-translational modifications.

2. **STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins)**: A large database designed to provide a critical assessment and integration of protein-protein interactions, including both direct (physical) and indirect (functional) associations. It covers a vast number of organisms and integrates data from various sources, including experimental data, computational prediction methods, and public text collections.

3. **GeneMania**: A user-friendly web interface that helps predict the function of genes and gene sets. GeneMania finds other genes that are related to a set of input genes, using a very large set of functional association data, including protein and genetic interactions, pathways, co-expression, co-localization, and protein domain similarity.

4. **IntAct**: An open-source database and toolkit for the storage, presentation, and analysis of protein interactions. IntAct provides a platform for the integration and dissemination of interaction data, focusing on providing a comprehensive and detailed dataset that is freely accessible.

5. **KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes)**: Although primarily known as a pathway database, KEGG also includes information on protein interactions, especially as they pertain to various pathways and processes. It integrates genomic, chemical, and systemic functional information.

6. **mmu_STRING**: This refers to the mouse-specific subset of the STRING database. It provides interaction data specifically for Mus musculus (mouse), which is a crucial model organism in biological research. Like the broader STRING database, it includes both physical and functional protein associations.

These PINs can be used to answer various bioinformatic questions, such as:

- **Elucidating Cellular Processes**: Understanding how proteins interact can reveal insights into the mechanisms of various cellular processes.
- **Identifying Disease Pathways**: Protein interactions are often altered in diseases, so these networks can help identify potential disease mechanisms or therapeutic targets.
- **Studying Protein Function**: By examining the interactions of a protein, researchers can infer its function.
- **Comparative Proteomics**: Comparing protein interactions across different species can provide insights into evolutionary conservation and differences.
- **Drug Target Discovery**: Identifying key nodes or interactions in a network can suggest potential targets for drug development.
